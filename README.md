# Challenge 3
## Acceptance Criteria
- When a user click the button to generate a password, the user will presented with a series of prompts for the password criteria:
  - User must confirm the length of the password, 8 characters minimum and 128 max.
  - User must confirm if they want to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
- When the criteria is set, the password will be displayed on the website.

## Description
For this challenge, I decided to ask the user for the criteria they want after they hit the button. By default, the generated password will be all lowercase. 
The user, however, can select if they want uppercase values combined with lowercase or all of them uppercase.
